# Python for Actions
This repository contains the code and scripts that we use to build Python packages used in [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) and accessible through the [setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) Action.  
File [versions-manifest.json](./versions-manifest.json) contains the list of available and released versions.  

> Caution: this is prepared for and only permitted for use by actions `virtual-environments` and `setup-python` action.

**Status**: Currently under development and in use for beta and preview actions.  This repo is undergoing rapid changes.

Some versions are pre-installed on [virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) images.  
More versions will (soon!) be available to install on-the-fly through the [`setup-python`](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) action.

## Adding new versions
We are trying to build and release new versions of Python as soon as they are released. Please open an issue in [actions/virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) if any versions are missing.
