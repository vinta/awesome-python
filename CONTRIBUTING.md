# Contributing

**Your contributions are always welcome!**

## Guidelines

* Add one link per Pull Request.
    * Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add project-name`.
    * Write down the reason why the library is awesome.
* Add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
    * Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Don't mention `Python` in the description as it's implied.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**
