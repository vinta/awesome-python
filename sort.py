"""
    The approach taken is explained below. I decided to do it simply.
    Initially I was considering parsing the data into some sort of
    structure and then generating an appropriate README. I am still
    considering doing it - but for now this should work. The only issue
    I see is that it only sorts the entries at the lowest level, and that
    the order of the top-level contents do not match the order of the actual
    entries.

    This could be extended by having nested blocks, sorting them recursively
    and flattening the end structure into a list of lines. Revision 2 maybe ^.^.
