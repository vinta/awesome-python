# APIsec addresses the critical need to secure APIs before they reach production. 
# APIsec provides the industryâ€™s only automated and continuous API testing platform that uncovers security vulnerabilities and logic flaws in APIs. 
# Clients rely on APIsec to evaluate every update and release, ensuring that no APIs go to production with vulnerabilities.

# How to Get Started with APIsec.ai
# 1. Schedule a demo at https://www.apisec.ai/request-a-demo .
#
# 2. Register your account at https://cloud.fxlabs.io/#/signup .
#
# 3. Register your API . See the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK3Xo9Dbvac) to get up and running with APIsec quickly.
#
# 4. Get GitHub Actions scan attributes from APIsec Project -> Configurations -> Integrations -> CI-CD -> GitHub Actions
#
# apisec-run-scan
#
# This action triggers the on-demand scans for projects registered in APIsec.
# If your GitHub account allows code scanning alerts, you can then upload the sarif file generated by this action to show the scan findings.
# Else you can view the scan results from the project home page in APIsec Platform.
# The link to view the scan results is also displayed on the console on successful completion of action.

# This is a starter workflow to help you get started with APIsec-Scan Actions
