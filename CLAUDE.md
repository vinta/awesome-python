## Repository Overview

This is the awesome-python repository - a curated list of Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources. The repository serves as a comprehensive directory about Python ecosystem.

## PR Review Guidelines

**For all PR review tasks, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** which contains:

- Acceptance criteria (Industry Standard, Rising Star, Hidden Gem)
- Quality requirements
- Automatic rejection criteria
- Entry format reference
- PR description template

## Architecture & Structure

The repository follows a single-file architecture:

- **README.md**: All content in hierarchical structure (categories, subcategories, entries)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Submission guidelines and review criteria
- **sort.py**: Script to enforce alphabetical ordering

Entry format: `* [project-name](url) - Concise description ending with period.`

## Key Considerations

- This is a curated list, not a code project
- Quality over quantity - only "awesome" projects
- Alphabetical ordering within categories is mandatory
- README.md is the source of truth for all content
